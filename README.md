### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Kiva.org

Kiva.org is an online crowdfunding platform to extend financial services to poor and financially excluded people around the world. Kiva lenders have provided over $1 billion dollars in loans to over 2 million people. In order to set investment priorities, help inform lenders, and understand their target communities, knowing the level of poverty of each borrower is critical. However, this requires inference based on a limited set of information for each borrower.<br>
The project and all the source datasets was provided by Kiva in the context of "Data Science for Good"-challenge on Kaggle. Kiva was inviting the Kaggle community to help them build more localized models to estimate the poverty levels of residents in the regions where Kiva has active loans. With a stronger understanding of their borrowers and their poverty levels, Kiva will be able to better assess and maximize the impact of their work. So I decided to participate in this progect to give my view and help the company. The project is done in 2 languages: English and Russian. <br>
Submissions in this challenge had the form of Python (and/or R) data analyses using Kernels, Kaggle's hosted Jupyter Notebooks-based workbench.
